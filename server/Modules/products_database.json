                "description": "Silence meets power. Silence the distractions. CMF Buds Pro takes 45 dB active noise reduction to another level with a bandwidth of up to 5000 Hz. With a wider frequency range, more types of noises can be eliminated. So even on busy commutes and in noisy office spaces, you can fully immerse yourself in your favorite audio. We built Buds Pro with a special wind-through structure that features two holes at the top of the stem. Combined with advanced wind noise reducing algorithms delivering uninterrupted conversations and immersive music experience. With 6 HD microphones and Clear Voice Technology that's been trained on 20,000,000+ noise models, enjoy the phone calls with next-level clarity. All about the bass. We developed CMF Buds Pro to transform the bass experience by ensuring hardware and software work together to enhance sound in real-time. Starting with hardware, the custom 10 mm driver features a premium LCP + PU diaphragm for high elasticity and more precision. The soft material of the PU is what allows the bass sound to come through purer and more accurate. We also gave the rear chamber an exhaust vent to make the mid-low frequencies fuller, the high frequencies clearer and low frequencies extra powerful. CMF Buds Pro features an intelligent bass enhancement algorithm that enhances the sound of bass in real-time. It detects music signals as you're listening and presents a clearer bass effect. You can customise sound yourself too with the Nothing X app. Just connect your CMF Buds Pro and use the Equaliser to adjust the sound of bass and treble. We designed CMF Buds Pro to support you throughout the entire day. Enjoy 11 hours of non-stop music playback on a single charge or extend your listening time to up to 39 hours by using the earbuds with the charging case (with ANC is turned off). Compatible with Fast Charge for quick and seamless power-ups. Get 5 hours of listening after just 10 minutes of charging.\r\n",
